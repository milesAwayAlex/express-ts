# Express with TypeScript

This is an (extremely) basic proof-of-concept project to demonstrate a way to use TypeScript in a Node app. It uses the tsc compiler and npm scripts to compile TS into JS before starting the server. The compilation is controlled by the settings in tsconfig.json. Tested on Node 16.

## Instructions

- Clone the repo
- (Optional) Browse the files. The repo does not contain `.js` files - those are generated by `tsc` at startup. The compilation script is in `package.json`
- Install the dependencies - `npm i`
- Start it - `npm start`
- Check `localhost:8000`
- TypeScript fun!
